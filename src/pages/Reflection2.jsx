            Engineers Australia (2017) explains that good communication means sharing information 
            clearly while also listening and understanding other people's views. During my internship 
            at Optik Consultancy, I saw how important this was when we presented our web application 
            to the client. They were pleased with what we had built, but as soon as they saw it, 
            they began asking for extra features that were not part of the original plan. They wanted 
            new charts, additional filters, and other options we had never discussed before.
          </p>

          <p>
            I felt proud that they liked our work, but I also felt stressed because we had limited 
            time left and could not add everything they wanted. It became clear that we had not 
            communicated the scope of the project well enough. We assumed the client understood the 
            limits of what we could deliver, but they saw the demo as a starting point for adding 
            more ideas. This situation made me realise how crucial it is to manage expectations 
            early on, especially when working with clients who are not familiar with the technical 
            effort behind each feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            Part of the problem was the difference in how we approached the project compared to the 
            client. They thought in terms of Excel and saw changes as "quick adjustments," while we 
            knew that even a small new feature could take days of coding, testing, and debugging. 
            There was a gap in understanding, and I realised that technical jargon and developer-focused 
            explanations don't always work with non-technical stakeholders. I learned that being a 
            professional means being able to explain technical constraints in simple terms, using 
            examples and visuals that clients can relate to. Engineers Australia (2017) highlights 
            this as a core skill for engineers, and I now understand why.
          </p>

          <p>
            Looking back, I think we could have avoided this problem by setting clear boundaries 
            and expectations from the start. We should have finalised a list of core features and 
            explained which requests would need to be postponed for a future phase. It would also 
            have helped to run regular mini demos during the project so the client could give 
            feedback earlier, rather than waiting until the end and asking for major changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            This experience also taught me about the importance of cultural and communication 
            differences. The client's priorities were focused on usability and business outcomes, 
            while our team was focused on technical feasibility and timelines. I realised I needed 
            to listen carefully to understand their needs, but also clearly explain the trade-offs 
            of each new request. For example, instead of saying, "We can't do that," I learned to 
            say, "We can add this feature, but it may delay other tasks, would you like to prioritise 
            this?" This approach made discussions more collaborative and solutions-focused.
          </p>

          <p>
            From this, I learned that professional practice is not just about technical skills but 
            also about building trust and having open conversations. Good communication involves 
            being transparent about challenges and helping clients make informed decisions. If I 
            had the chance to do this again, I would prepare plain-language summaries of the system, 
            with visuals showing how each feature works and what effort is required for changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            In future projects and my career, I will apply these learnings by being proactive in 
            explaining scope limits, presenting trade-offs clearly, and creating shared understanding 
            between technical and non-technical stakeholders. This will help me build stronger 
            professional relationships, manage intercultural and global projects more effectively, 
            and ensure software solutions meet both business goals and technical realities. This 
            experience has shown me that strong communication and expectation management are as 
            important as technical expertise, and I will carry this forward as a core part of my 
            professional practice.
