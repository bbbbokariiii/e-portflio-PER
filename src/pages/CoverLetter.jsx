            <p><strong>Dear Hiring Manager,</strong></p>
            
            <p><strong>Re: Software Stream â€“ Industrus Engineering Graduate Program</strong></p>
            
            <p>
              I am writing to apply for the Industrus Graduate Program. As a 2nd-year Software 
              Engineering student at the University of Technology Sydney with hands-on experience 
              in database design, web development, and client collaboration, I believe I am 
              well-suited to contribute to Industrus' innovative engineering projects.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              During my internship at Optik Consultancy, I was trusted to manage sensitive client 
              data while developing a MongoDB database and a React web application. I ensured all 
              work was delivered transparently, with accurate documentation and version control, 
              so both the client and my team could track decisions. This built trust and reinforced 
              my commitment to ethical conduct and accountability.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I also developed strong communication skills when gathering requirements from clients. 
              At times, technical terms caused confusion, so I used plain-language explanations and 
              diagrams to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders. This 
              helped the client feel understood and allowed our team to deliver solutions on time.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              In my Engineers Without Borders Challenge project, I collaborated in a team of six 
              to design a prototype app providing early warnings for environmental risks. My role 
              involved researching user needs, contributing to the design, and presenting the 
              prototype. The project was praised for its creativity and practicality, and I learned 
              how to work proactively and think innovatively under time pressure.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Beyond technical projects, I have shown the ability to manage my own performance as 
              a private tutor with Alchemy Tuition, where I deliver four lessons per week. This 
              role requires careful time management, planning, and adaptability to meet the needs 
              of different students. My students' improved grades and confidence show I can work 
              independently while achieving results.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Teamwork and leadership are also central to my development. In my volunteer role with 
              UTSMS, I worked with a team of eight creatives to design event graphics and campaigns, 
              increasing social media engagement by 35%. I often took the lead on deadlines and 
              coordination, strengthening my ability to collaborate and guide others in fast-paced 
              environments.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Industrus' projects, especially 
              those that combine innovation, sustainability, and real-world impact. I would welcome 
              the chance to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your graduate program.
            </p>
            
            <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong><br />Mifrah Raiz</p>
